# 📉 E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior data from an e-commerce platform to understand customer churn patterns and identify opportunities to improve customer retention.
Customer churn can significantly impact revenue, making it important to understand which customer behaviors are linked to higher churn risk.

The analysis focuses on understanding differences between churned and active customers using behavioral, transactional, and engagement data.
