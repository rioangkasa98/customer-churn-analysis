# 📉 E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for e-commerce businesses, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project analyzes customer behavior and transaction patterns to identify factors associated with customer churn and generate actionable insights to improve customer retention.

The analysis focuses on understanding differences between churned and active customers using behavioral, transactional, and engagement data.

## ❓ Problem Statement
E-commerce companies face significant revenue loss when customers stop using their services.  
Without understanding the characteristics and behavior of churned customers, businesses struggle to design effective retention strategies.

This project aims to answer:
- What patterns differentiate churned customers from active customers?
- Which factors are most strongly associated with churn?
- How can these insights support data-driven retention strategies?

## 🎯 Business Questions
- What demographic and behavioral characteristics are common among churned customers?
- How does purchasing behavior differ between churned and active customers?
- Which engagement metrics indicate higher churn risk?
- What customer segments should be prioritized for retention efforts?
